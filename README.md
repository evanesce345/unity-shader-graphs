This demo showcases a functioning lightsaber in a first-person view. 

## Features

- The player can move around, jump and swing the lightsaber and interact with nearby objects.
- When the lightsaber "hits" an object, a visual scrape will be left on the object, and an audio cue will play.
- Particle effects will also pop out of the area that was attacked.
- "Enemies" (capsules) can be damaged and will "die" when their health reaches 0.
- The lightsaber can retract and extend, and the physics function as would be expected.

## Controls

**WASD** - to move  
**Space** - to jump  
**E** - to retract/extend lightsaber  
**Left-click** - to attack
